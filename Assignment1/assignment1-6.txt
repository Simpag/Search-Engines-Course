Precision = 5/6 (~83%)
Recall = 5/100 (~5%)

Precision is increased from originally 53% to 83% due to a lot less irrelevant documents. However, some teir 1 relevancy documents are not retrieved. 
Recall is lowered from 9% to 5%, this is due to the fact that less minor relevant documents are retrieved. If one were to be more strict in the 
relevance scoring then the recall would most likely have stayed the same. In order to increase recall one can make a query that retrieved more documents
that are slightly relevant but lowering the informational content in the query.
